1. Prevention   
a. Limit and Secure Privileges:   
  Account Management: Minimize the number of accounts with elevated privileges.   
  Strong Passwords: Use robust, unique passwords for all administrative accounts.   
  Multi-factor Authentication: Implement MFA for critical system access.   

  For this step i would recommend using the powershell script DCShadow Attack.ps1 in this folder.
  Executing this script with administrator privileges will return a csv file that includes a list of every
  Account that posses the required permissions to execute this attack.
  After running it you should go over the list and remove unwanted members.
  The next step would be to check for password strength & setting a Multi-Factor auth for thos accounts in order to ensure maximum security 


b. Network Segmentation:   
  Isolate Critical Assets: Keep domain controllers in secure network segments.   
  Restricted Communication: Limit inter-segment communication to necessary traffic only.   

c. Regular Patching:   
  Updates: Regularly patch all systems, with a focus on Domain Controllers.   

2. Detection   
a. Monitor Active Directory:   
  ATA: Utilize tools like Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA).   
  Monitor Registrations: Be alert to unexpected domain controller registrations.   
b. Use SIEM Solutions:   
  Log Analysis: Implement SIEM solutions to aggregate and analyze system logs.   
  Alerts: Set system alerts for unusual replication activities.   
c. Regularly Review Permissions:   
  Audit: Periodically audit AD permissions.   
  Alert on Changes: Monitor for unexpected permission changes.   

3. Response   
a. Incident Response Plan:   
  Planning: Have a pre-defined plan for suspicious activities.   
b. Investigate and Remediate:   
  Incident Review: Upon receiving an alert, follow your incident response plan.   
  Identify and Revert: If DCShadow is detected, identify the rogue entity, revert changes, and remove rogue components.   
c. Improve and Update:   
  Post-Incident Analysis: Post-incident, review and understand the attack vector.   
  Update Mechanisms: Enhance prevention and detection based on new insights.   

4. Continuous Improvement   
  a. Stay Updated:   
    Continuous Learning: Stay informed about emerging threats and best practices.   
  b. Continuous Monitoring:   
    Environment Checks: Regularly inspect the environment for potential threats or vulnerabilities.   

5. Backup and Recovery   
  a. Regular Backups:   
    Data Protection: Regularly backup Active Directory and vital systems.
